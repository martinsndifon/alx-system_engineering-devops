# SSH
SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol
that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a
computer over an unsecured network.

SSH also refers to the suite of utilities that implement the SSH protocol.
Secure Shell provides strong password authentication and public key
authentication, as well as encrypted data communications between two computers
connecting over an open network, such as the internet.
