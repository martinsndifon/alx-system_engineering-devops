A regular expression sometimes referred to as rational expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search
pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace"
operations on strings, or for input validation.
This repository contains ruby scripts that demonstrates the usage of regular expressions for searching operations.
