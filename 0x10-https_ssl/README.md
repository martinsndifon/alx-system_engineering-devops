# HTTPS - Hyper text transfer protocol secure

This is the same transfer protocol as http, the only difference is that is a secure way
of doing it. The 's' stands for secure, it adds encryption and decryption to the protocol.
Https ensures that data transfered between client and server on the internet cannot be
understood by a third party even if they are able to intercept the data being transfered.
